## MIS 333K Final Project
---
This is the banking website my team and I created for the final project for our class on C# and MVC.  Users are able to create logins; open various types of accounts including checkings, savings, stock portfolios, and IRA accounts; and transfer money between the accounts--among other functionality.

## Stack
---
This web application relies heavily on Microsoft's MVC, Entity, and Identity frameworks.  HTML pages are rendered with Razor and as styling wasn't a factor in our final grade, a simple Bootstrap theme is all we applied in that regard.
